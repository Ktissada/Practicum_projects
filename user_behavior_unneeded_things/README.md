**Project Description:**

The ambitious team behind the ‚ÄúUnneeded Things‚Äù service is looking for mobile app analysts! The client is a product manager focused on improving user engagement in our mobile application. To enhance these metrics, we need to analyze user behavior in the app:
	‚Ä¢	Examining the relationship between the contact view event and other user actions. Identifying common scenarios leading to contact views.
	‚Ä¢	Evaluating which actions are most frequently performed by users who view contacts.
	‚Ä¢	Using statistical hypothesis testing to determine factors influencing the likelihood of a user reaching the contact view stage and making a call.
	‚Ä¢	Analyzing user journeys and product metrics to assess feature effectiveness and identify behavioral patterns.

üìä Tools used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), Jupyter Notebook.
